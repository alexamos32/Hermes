# Hermes
Hermes is a powerful note taking application that provides a whole host of features to the tech savvy user, tired of the basic text-based apps present in the smartphone world.

The core feature of this application is Markdown support. Markdown is a powerful text editing language that allows a text document to be turned into HTML with various character sequences. With the use of Markdown it provides a much easier method to create well formatted, readable documents purely through typing, without clicking numerous buttons around a smartphone screen.
